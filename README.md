# Mindure â€” A Smart Productivity & Focus Guard Extension

**Mindure** is a lightweight, student-built Chrome extension that helps you **stay focused** and **endure distractions** â€” not by blocking everything blindly, but by using a smart **AI check** that guides you back to what really matters.

## ðŸš€ What is Mindure?

ðŸ§  **Key Idea:**  
- The core feature is an **AI-powered content check** â€” it scans the tabâ€™s title, URL, and context to decide if what youâ€™re viewing is actually *study-related* or just a distraction.  
- If itâ€™s not helpful, Mindure gently warns you or blocks the page â€” so you stay mindful and productive.  
- Defining your own allowed/block sites is **optional** â€” the AI does the work by default, with custom site rules and keywords planned for future updates.

âœ… **Why itâ€™s better:**  
- Keeps useful sites like YouTube open for real study content â€” blocks unrelated rabbit holes.  
- Learns with you â€” fewer manual tweaks, more freedom to focus.  
- Works on Chromium-based browsers (*Chrome, Brave, Edge*). Firefox version planned.

ðŸ”’ **Privacy-first:**  
All checks run locally or securely via your chosen AI API â€” **no browsing data is stored or sold**. Your focus stays yours.
